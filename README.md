### **How it works :**

  

1. Allows users to enter names into a text box.

2. Allows users the enter the number of random names they want into a text box.

3. A `Generate Random Names` button that intiates the randomization of the name in the text box.

4. The selected random names are displayed to the browser.

5. Each time the `Generate Random Names` button is pressed, the previous names should be cleared, and a new selection of names should appear (instead of the new selection adding the prior list).

6. The application should make sure that number entered by the user does not exceed the amount of names entered for randomization.

7. If the numbered entered by the user is larger than the amount of names entered, an alert should appear informting the user of this.

8. A button named 'Clear' that removes the populated list from the screen.

9. The application should have a simple, visually pleasing design

 Note: Do not spend too much time on design. Focus primarily on functionality(i.e. steps 1-8).
